#about me
st.write("I am deeply driven by the human ability to reach unlimited skill levels in any pursuit. My work has been shaped by my passion for data, product, and analytics. \n\nIn my current role, I am collecting, unpacking, transforming, and readying data to create measures of success. I enable partner clients to demystify supply chain value levers and help them take data-informed decisions through embedded analytics and data exploration dashboards.\n\nPreviously, I led a team of seven technical product managers to plan, prioritize, and deliver company-wide client ad-hoc requests, ensuring increased NPS and streamlined tech bandwidth. I also raised over $500,000 in government grants for Canadian tech startups in 2020 and increased the retail stores' revenue for a 30- year-old retail company through a mix of digitization, gamification, and analytics in 2019.\n\nMy experience also includes being part of the team behind the 2017 indie game of the year on Google Play (Canada - Beast Brawlers), starting a games development company in India, and developing a text-based web game built over three years using the LAMP tech stack (PHP, MySQL) in 2011.\n\nI resonate highly with the teachings of Geeta and love spending time with my dog. I am always curious and believe that by providing more information, feedback, and using specific language, we can get the most out of any interaction.")
